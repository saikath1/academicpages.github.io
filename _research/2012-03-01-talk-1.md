This work establishes an empirical relationship and preliminary model characterizing the relationship between reliability investment and life-cycle support costs to identify a subsystem-level
reliability optimization strategy that minimizes lifecycle cost. The study introduced an additional dimension of reliability engineering into tradespace study. The research was extended to consider
the improvement of reliability engineering processes and removed the assumption that parameters of the reliability improvement equations are constant. This material is based upon work supported by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) through the National Institute of Aerospace (NIA) under Prime Cooperative Agreement.

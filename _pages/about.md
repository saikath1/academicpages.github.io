My name is Saikath Bhattacharya. Presently, I am postdoctoral research scholar at the [Science of Security Lablet](https://research.csc.ncsu.edu/security/lablet/) at the North Carolina State University.  I completed my PhD from the [Dependable Software and Systems Laboratory](https://lfiondella.sites.umassd.edu/). My thesis advisor was [Dr. Lance Fiondella](https://www.umassd.edu/directory/lfiondella/) at the [University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth](https://www.umassd.edu/engineering/ece/). 

I graduated with top 5% in the class with a Master's of Technology  from the Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT) in Communication Systems in 2011 and with a Bachelor's of Engineering from Nagpur University in 2009. From 2011-2014, I was a Lecturer at School of Electronics, KIIT.


Area of interest
---
I am interested in reliability and software engineering, cyber-physical systems, failure prediction, and test and validation of AI systems. My thesis explored tradespace exploration, design of alternates, and subsystem reliability investment models to reduce lifecycle operational and support cost for rotorcrafts. I have also developed cost-based metrics and framework to assess Li-ion battery prognostics.

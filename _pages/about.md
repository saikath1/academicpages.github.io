My name is Saikath Bhattacharya. I am currently a PhD candidate at the at the [Software-Intensive System Reliability Lab](https://sasdlc.org/lab/#/) at the [University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth](https://www.umassd.edu/engineering/ece/).  

I graduated with top 5% in the class with a Master's of Technology  from the kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology in Communication Systems in 2011 and with a Bachelor's of Engineering from Nagpur University in 2009. From 2011-2014, I was a Lecturer at School of Electronics, KIIT University.

Research
======

I am interested in the intersection of reliability, life cycle cost estimation, and machine learning. Specifically, I use applied machine leaning methods to predict system failure. I have researched the tradespace exploration and subsystem reliability investment models to reduce lifecycle operational and support cost for rotorcrafts. I have also developed new cost-based metrics and framework to assess Li-ion battery prognostics.

My work has been published in  Research in Engineering Design Journal, International Journal of Reliability, Quality and Safety Engineering, American Helicopter Society, and IEEE Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium, and in Massachusetts Department of Transportation.

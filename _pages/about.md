My name is Saikath Bhattacharya. I completed my PhD from the [Dependable Software and Systems Laboratory](https://lfiondella.sites.umassd.edu/). My thesis advisor was [Dr. Lance Fiondella](https://www.umassd.edu/directory/lfiondella/) at the [University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth](https://www.umassd.edu/engineering/ece/). 

I graduated with top 5% in the class with a Master's of Technology  from the Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT) in Communication Systems in 2011 and with a Bachelor's of Engineering from Nagpur University in 2009. From 2011-2014, I was a Lecturer at School of Electronics, KIIT.


Area of interest
---
I am interested in the intersection of reliability engineering, life cycle cost estimation, and test and validation of AI systems. I use applied machine leaning methods to predict system failure. I have researched the tradespace exploration, design of alternates, and subsystem reliability investment models to reduce lifecycle operational and support cost for rotorcrafts. I have also developed new cost-based metrics and framework to assess Li-ion battery prognostics.
